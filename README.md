"Monitoring and Analysis of Plastic Pollution in Aquatic Environments"

A comprehensive monitoring initiative is underway in Argentina, focusing on its freshwater systemsâ€”lakes, shallow lakes, reservoirs, streams and rivers. The project named MappA (Monitoring and Analysis of Plastic Pollution in Aquatic Environments) aims to implement a standardized methodology to comprehensively understand the prevalence and specific attributes of microplastics within these water sources, marking the first systematic effort of its kind in South America. MappA is currently developing a study including 95 study sites (24 lakes, 19 shallow lakes, 8 dams, 30 rivers, 14 streams; Fig. 1), involving the collaboration of over 60 aquatic science experts, and the expertise of 40 institutes and research centers from Argentina.
